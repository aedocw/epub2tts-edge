## üìñ Usage
<details>
<summary> Usage instructions</summary>

*NOTE:* If you want to specify where NLTK tokenizer will be stored (about 50mb), use an environment variable: `export NLTK_DATA="your/path/to/nltk_data"`

## OPTIONAL - activate the virutal environment if using
1. `source .venv/bin/activate`

## FIRST - extract epub contents to text and cover image to png:
1. `epub2tts-edge mybook.epub`
2. **edit mybook.txt**, replacing `# Part 1` etc with desired chapter names, and removing front matter like table of contents and anything else you do not want read. **Note:** First two lines can be Title: and Author: to use that in audiobook metadata.

## Read text to audiobook:

* `epub2tts-edge mybook.txt --cover mybook.png`
* Optional: specify a speaker with `--speaker <speaker>`. List available voices with `edge-tts --list-voices`, default speaker is `en-US-AndrewNeural` if `--speaker` is not specified.


## All options
* `-h, --help` - show this help message and exit
* `--speaker SPEAKER` - Speaker to use (example: en-US-EricNeural)
* `--cover image.[jpg|png]` - image to use for cover
* `--paragraphpause <N>` - number of milliseconds to pause between paragraphs
* `--sentencepause <N>` - number of milliseconds to pause between sentences

## Deactivate virtual environment
`deactivate`

<summary>MAC INSTALLATION</summary>

This installation requires Python < 3.12 and [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (I use homebrew to install espeak, [pyenv](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36968425/how-can-i-install-multiple-versions-of-python-on-latest-os-x-and-use-them-in-par) and ffmpeg).

```
#install dependencies
brew install espeak pyenv ffmpeg
#install epub2tts-edge
git clone https://github.com/aedocw/epub2tts-edge
cd epub2tts-edge
pyenv install 3.11
pyenv local 3.11
#OPTIONAL - install this in a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install .
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>LINUX INSTALLATION</summary>

These instructions are for Ubuntu 22.04 (20.04 showed some depedency issues), but should work (with appropriate package installer mods) for just about any repo. Ensure you have `ffmpeg` installed before use.

```
#install dependencies
sudo apt install espeak-ng ffmpeg
#clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/aedocw/epub2tts-edge
cd epub2tts-edge
#OPTIONAL - install this in a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install .
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>WINDOWS INSTALLATION</summary>

Runnig epub2tts in WSL2 with Ubuntu 22 is the easiest approach, but these steps should work for running directly in windows.

(TBD)
