<summary> Usage instructions</summary>

*NOTE:* If you want to specify where NLTK tokenizer will be stored (about 50mb), use an environment variable: `export NLTK_DATA="your/path/to/nltk_data"`

## OPTIONAL - activate the virutal environment if using
1. `source .venv/bin/activate`

## FIRST - extract epub contents to text and cover image to png:
1. `epub2tts-edge mybook.epub`
2. **edit mybook.txt**, replacing `# Part 1` etc with desired chapter names, and removing front matter like table of contents and anything else you do not want read. **Note:** First two lines can be Title: and Author: to use that in audiobook metadata.

## Read text to audiobook:

* `epub2tts-edge mybook.txt --cover mybook.png`
* Optional: specify a speaker with `--speaker <speaker>`. List available voices with `edge-tts --list-voices`, default speaker is `en-US-AndrewNeural` if `--speaker` is not specified.


## All options
* `-h, --help` - show this help message and exit
* `--speaker SPEAKER` - Speaker to use (example: en-US-EricNeural)
* `--cover image.[jpg|png]` - image to use for cover
* `--paragraphpause <N>` - number of milliseconds to pause between paragraphs
* `--sentencepause <N>` - number of milliseconds to pause between sentences

## Deactivate virtual environment
`deactivate`

## üì¶ Install

<summary>MAC INSTALLATION</summary>

This installation requires Python < 3.12 and [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (I use homebrew to install espeak, [pyenv](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36968425/how-can-i-install-multiple-versions-of-python-on-latest-os-x-and-use-them-in-par) and ffmpeg).

```
#install dependencies
brew install espeak pyenv ffmpeg
#install epub2tts-edge
git clone https://github.com/aedocw/epub2tts-edge
cd epub2tts-edge
pyenv install 3.11
pyenv local 3.11
#OPTIONAL - install this in a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install .
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>LINUX INSTALLATION</summary>

These instructions are for Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS and 22.04  (20.04 showed some depedency issues), but should work (with appropriate package installer mods) for just about any distro. Ensure you have `ffmpeg` installed before use.

```
#install dependencies
sudo apt install espeak-ng ffmpeg python3-venv
#clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/aedocw/epub2tts-edge
cd epub2tts-edge
#OPTIONAL - install this in a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install .
```

<details>
<summary>WINDOWS INSTALLATION</summary>

Running epub2tts in WSL2 with Ubuntu 22 is the easiest approach, but these steps should work for running directly in windows.

This guide will assume that you know how to use:
1. Windows PowerShell, some basics like running commands and changing directories
2. GIT clone or at least capability to download repository from github site  

This installation requires: python3.11, espeak-ng, ffmpeg.
To whitch appropriate windows versions are provided throughout the installation process below:


STEP 1: Get and set up all requirements:  
Install [python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3117/).  
Install latest [espeak-ng](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/releases) release (.msi x64 for 64 bit windows).  
Download [ffmpeg](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases/download/latest/ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl.zip) package, github release has binaries for windows.  
Unpack ffmpeg and add the bin folder to environmental variables according to this [tutorial](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/ffmpeg-windows).  


STEP 2: Copy repository and install the app and its dependencies using PowerShell:  
Install virtual environment python library:
```
pip install virtualenv
```
Clone the repo to your desired directory, i'll use 'C:\epub2tts-edge' as an example:
```
git clone https://github.com/aedocw/epub2tts-edge
```
Set powershell directory to your cloned repo:
```
cd C:\epub2tts-edge
```
Create virtual environment inside the directory:
```
py -m venv .venv
```
Run the app in virtual environment:
```
.venv\scripts\activate
```
Install the app and its required libs inside:
```
pip install .
```


STEP 3: Test the app and make sure everything works as intended.  
This is done by geting a short sample ebook and converting it to an audiobook using the app.  
Download [this sample ebook](https://github.com/bmaupin/epub-samples/releases/download/v0.3/basic-v3plus2.epub), or anything from [epub-samples](https://github.com/bmaupin/epub-samples/releases/) on github (or something short with a cover).  

Now run this command on your .epub to convert it to a separate text and cover image:
```
epub2tts-edge sample.epub
```
You should now have both sample.txt and sample.png in the repo folder, you can check them out and edit them before making an audiobook.  

Lastly, run the conversion and make a sample TTS audiobook:
```
epub2tts-edge sample.txt --cover sample.png
```
Installation done, you should now get a sample.m4u file. If it works then it's all good and you can get into converting your books.

<details>
<summary>DOCKER</summary>

Build the image

```
docker build . -t epub2tts_edge
```

Generate the txt file and modify as necessary.

```
docker run --rm -it -v ~/Downloads:/files epub2tts_edge "/files/<epub_file>.epub"
```

Generate audiobook.

```
docker run --rm -it -v ~/Downloads:/files epub2tts_edge "/files/<epub_file>.txt" [options]
```

The volume argument `~/Downloads:/files` maps `~/Downloads` on the host, to the path `/files` inside the container, so our paths added as cli arguments should also include the `/files` base path.

## Updating

<details>
<summary>UPDATING YOUR INSTALLATION</summary>

1. cd to repo directory
2. `git pull`
3. Activate virtual environment you installed epub2tts in if you installed in a virtual environment using "source .venv/bin/activate"
4. `pip install . --upgrade`
</details>
